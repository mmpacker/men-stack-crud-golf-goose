# Golf Goose
### by Matt Packer

*Golf Goose* is a full 'MEN' stack applicatioon that makes full use of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) data operations.

This application is designed to help golf enthusiasts access a database of golf courses developed and maintained by users. Users can login to the app using their Google account (using Google OAuth) and then view a list of courses in the Golf Goose database, add new golf courses to the database, edit and delete course details for golf courses they created, add golf courses to a list of courses they have played, add reviews to courses they have played, and view reviews left by other users.

*Golf Goose* was created during the second unit of [General Assembly](https://www.generalassemb.ly)'s Software Engineering Immersive program. The initial version was planned, developed and deployed over the course of about one week. It was created from scratch using technologies in the ‘MEN’ stack, including MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, and Node.

Future enhancements are planned. See below for a list of ‘icebox’ features that I plan to implement in the future.


### Getting Started:
The app can be lauched [here](https://mp-golf-goose.herokuapp.com/) and was deployed using Heroku.

I used [Trello](https://trello.com/b/T4z0YNwu/mmp-seir-unit-2-project-golf-goose#) to keep myself organized when planning and developing Golf Goose.
